# README

A console based vending machine application, offering 5 different items and a secret, password protected service mode to add more items/change prices/restock/add coins etc.

My first OOP project, using enums, interfaces, multiple classes, inheritance, encapsulation etc.

* As a personal project I am currently learning JavaFX to add a GUI to move this out of the console and make it a bit more interesting 

Instructions for use:
