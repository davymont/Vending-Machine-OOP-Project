* As a personal project I am currently learning JavaFX to add a GUI to move this out of the console and make it a bit more interesting *

A console based vending machine application, offering 5 different items and a secret, password protected service mode to add more items/change prices/restock etc.

My first OOP project, using enums, interfaces, multiple classes, inheritance, encapsulation etc.

Instructions for use: 

Run Vending-Machine-OOP-Project/Assessment2/src/part02/VendingMachineApplication.java in your favourite Java IDE
